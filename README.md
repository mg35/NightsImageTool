# NightsImageTool
A tool I threw together to extract images from Steam NiGHTS Into Dreams and mod them as well. I'm no expert at making programs work on different machines but this _should_ work if you have Windows 10 64-bit. It probably won't work on a Mac. The program's menu is pretty much self-explanatory as to how it works. Just download the .exe to a folder of your choice and run.
